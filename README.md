Text-Based Risk Prediction of Cardiac Complications
Overview
This project aims to predict cardiac complications using natural language processing (NLP), PySpark, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms. We analyze unstructured clinical text data (such as Electronic Health Records) to identify risk factors associated with heart disease.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing:
Extract relevant features from clinical text using NLP techniques.
Utilize PySpark for efficient data processing.
Model Training:
Train a Random Forest Classifier on the processed data.
Combine machine learning and deep learning approaches for robust predictions.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model using the following metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Out-of-Sample Prediction:
Apply the trained model to new, unseen data for real-world predictions.
Installation
